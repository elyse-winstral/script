# Welcome

### The idea behind this repo is to combine Markdown and Marimo to create a script with accesible (and editable) code snippets.
## Navigation
The docs file is not important for students, only the markdown files will be. A very brief example of one is presented in the [chapter-notes](https://github.com/elyse-winstral/script/blob/main/Chapter-notes.md). Throughout the markdown files notebooks can be linked. The notebooks can provide students with editable code blocks to understand the code presented in the lectures, along with interactive visualizations to better understand specific concepts. 


# Preliminary check on python notebooks

The following should link to an editable Python notebook about Monte Carlo methods (adapted from [Philipp's](https://gist.github.com/philipp-harms/0404a6cd648be8fc59df4bc06794a566)).
check out this [notebook](https://elyse-winstral.github.io/script/notebook2.html) (a different notebook is linked in chapter-nodes to illustrate a more interactive notebook)


## Major to do: 
1. Add a Github tutorial for the students 
    1. Create an account/ link account with ETH account
    2. Request GitHub Education access via ETH 
    3. Script navigation / using copilot in conjunction with script
    4. (Use in vsc)
2.
