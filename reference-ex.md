**$\sigma$ algebra:** Let $S$ be some set and let $P(S)$ represent its power set (the set of all subsets of $S$). Then a subset $\Sigma \subset P(S)$ is called a $\sigma$-algebra if it satisifes the following three properties:

1. $S$ is in $\Sigma$
2. If $A \in \Sigma$, then $S \setminus A \in \Sigma$
3. If $A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots$ are in $\Sigma$, then so is their union $\bigcup A_i$
